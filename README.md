Bulk Radio Selector is a web extension that helps select all the radio buttons at once on a web page. This extension will only work with Chromium-based web browsers, e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.

### Usage Instructions
**How to Install:**
- Download this repo by going to `Code` -> `Download ZIP`, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/iamrasel/bulk-rads/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
- Navigate to your browser's `Manage Extensions` window.
- Enable `Developer mode` (top right corner) if it's not already enabled.
- Click on `Load unpacked` and select the folder where you've extracted the ZIP file's contents.
- The extension should now be added to your browser.

**How to Use:**
- Pin the extension to your browser's toolbar (optional, for better accessibility).
- Click on the extension icon; two buttons will appear. You should know what to do with them!
- Clicking any of the buttons will select all the radio buttons present on that specific page.
- Don't move to the next page just yet. Click on the `Complete` button and check the selection count.
- If the selection count doesn't match what you expected, wait a few seconds (e.g., 4â€“5 seconds) and check the count again. This depends on the server's response time. If the server's load time is good, you won't need to wait at all.
- If the selection count is still lower than expected, just refresh the page. It should be fine now.
- Follow the above steps to complete each page.
- In the `Complete` dialog box, the no match count number will change color based on the selection count.
